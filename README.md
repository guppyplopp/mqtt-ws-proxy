# MQTT-PROXY

## Aim

This is a very simple local proxy, which takes details of an MQTT broker, and then forwards all messages recieved on the subscribed topic, to the same topic on a Secure Websocket local server.

It may need tweaking to work for your specific scenario, so forking is encourage, but it should provide a decent foundation.

Designed for use with my MQTT Topic Tree explorer because, well, why not right? ðŸ˜‰

## To use

1) Clone this repo, or fork if you need to make changes to the behaviour to set it up for your broker.
2) Modify the .env (copied from .env.example) file (note: `SERVER_*` and `CLIENT_*` env vars are able to be the same if needed). *Note: if you need a certificate, the recommendation solution is to use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)*
3) Install the dependancies using `npm i`.
4) Run the proxy with `npm run dev`.
5) Explore this using https://tomdev10-mqtt-topic-tree.netlify.app/, which should open and connect automatically.


## Troubleshooting

Note: if the connection in browser fails to the local secure server, you may need to alter your browser configuration as below:

### Chrome

Visit the URL to allow the connection `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost`

### Firefox

Navigate to `about:config` and look at `network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS` and allow insecure.
You may also need to visit `https://localhost:8888` and/or `https://127.0.0.1:8888` and accept the insecure certificate.

### Safari

Visit `wss://localhost:8888` and accept the certificate, and navigate to the page. It will get stuck loading, but should then allow you to use the explorer.
